- Polymorphism : Different types of Bank accounts are 'treated the same way' (PrintAccountInfo method) but their 'results are different'. Thus, the results are of different form through same source.
- All bank accounts could be accessed through the same variable 'IAccount account'
- Unlike default program we are responding to the same method call all times 'IAccount.GetAccountInfo()' not individually 'SavingsAccount.GetAccountInfo()' and 'CheckingAccount.GetAccountInfo()' 
- In a sense, interfaces ties common logical types together in one single type so that we do not have to access each type individually
- "Polymorphism is the ability of derived classes inheriting from the same base class to respond to the same method call in their own unique way" -Beginning C# OOP By Dan Clark. It is not only about
   providing implementation of an interface member in dervied class it is about calling same member and getting different results based on the implementation in dervied classes.
- Interfaces are also a way in C# for multiple inheritance
